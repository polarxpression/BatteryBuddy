# Battery Buddy Blueprint

## High-Level Overview

Battery Buddy is a web application designed for efficient battery inventory management. It allows users to track their battery stock, manage battery types, and generate reports. The application is aimed at individuals and small businesses that need a simple yet powerful tool to keep their battery inventory organized.

## Low-Level Overview

### Data Model

The core of the application revolves around the `Battery` object, which has the following structure:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the battery.
- `type`: The type of the battery (e.g., AA, AAA, 9V).
- `brand`: The brand of the battery.
- `model`: The model of the battery.
- `quantity`: The number of batteries in stock.
- `packSize`: The number of batteries in a pack.
- `barcode`: The barcode of the battery pack.
- `discontinued`: A boolean indicating if the battery is discontinued.
- `location`: The location of the battery (e.g., "gondola", "stock").
- `imageUrl`: A URL to an image of the battery.
- `createdAt`: The date the battery was added to the inventory.
- `updatedAt`: The date the battery was last updated.
- `lastUsed`: The date the battery was last used.

The application also uses an `AppSettings` object to store user-specific settings, such as custom battery types, pack sizes, and brands.

### Core Components

The application is built using a component-based architecture. The main components are:

- `BatteryDashboard`: The main dashboard of the application, which displays an overview of the battery inventory.
- `BatteryInventoryTable`: A table that displays the battery inventory, with sorting and filtering capabilities.
- `AddEditBatterySheet`: A form for adding and editing batteries.
- `QuickAddBattery`: A simplified form for quickly adding batteries to the inventory.
- `RestockReport`: A report that shows which batteries need to be restocked.
- `RestockSuggestions`: A component that suggests which batteries to restock based on usage.
- `GenerateReportModal`: A modal for generating various reports, such as inventory summaries and restock reports.
- `SettingsModal`: A modal for managing application settings.

### Features

- **Inventory Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete batteries from the inventory. The application keeps track of the quantity of each battery type.
- **Reporting**: Users can generate reports, including inventory summaries and restock reports. Reports can be exported to CSV and PDF formats.
- **Search**: The application has a powerful search functionality that allows users to search for batteries by type, brand, model, and barcode.
- **Settings**: Users can customize the application to their needs, such as adding custom battery types, pack sizes, and brands.
- **Theme**: The application supports both light and dark themes.

### Backend

The application uses **Firebase** as its backend for data storage. It uses Firestore to store the battery inventory and user settings.

### Frontend

The frontend of the application is built with **React** and **TypeScript**. It uses a set of modern UI components to provide a clean and intuitive user interface. The application is also a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, which means it can be installed on a mobile device and used offline.
